22 Digital-to-analog converter (DAC)
22.1 DAC introduction
The DAC module is a 12-bit, voltage output digital-to-analog converter. The DAC can be
configured in 8- or 12-bit mode and may be used in conjunction with the DMA controller.
In 12-bit mode, the data can be left- or right-aligned. The DAC features two output channels,
each with its own converter. In dual DAC channel mode, conversions can be done
independently or simultaneously when both channels are grouped together for synchronous
update operations. An input reference pin, VREF+ (shared with others analog peripherals) is
available for better resolution. An internal reference can also be set on the same input.
Refer to voltage reference buffer (VREFBUF) section.
The DACx_OUTy pin can be used as general purpose input/output (GPIO) when the DAC
output is disconnected from output pad and connected to on chip peripheral. The DAC
output buffer can be optionally enabled to obtain a high drive output current. An individual
calibration can be applied on each DAC output channel. The DAC output channels support
a low power mode, the sample and hold mode.
22.2 DAC main features
The DAC main features are the following (see [Figure 163](../figures/figure_163.md): Dual-channel DAC block
diagram)
• One DAC interface, maximum two output channels
• Left or right data alignment in 12-bit mode
• Synchronized update capability
• Noise-wave and Triangular-wave generation
• Dual DAC channel for independent or simultaneous conversions
• DMA capability for each channel including DMA underrun error detection

The DAC includes:
• Up to two output channels
• The DACx_OUTy can be disconnected from the output pin and used as an ordinary
GPIO
• The DAC_OUTx can use an internal pin connection to on-chip peripherals such as
comparator, operational amplifier and ADC (if available).
• DAC output channel buffered or non buffered
• Sample and hold block and registers operational in Stop mode, using the LSI clock
source for static conversion.
The DAC includes up to two separate output channels. Each output channel can be
connected to on-chip peripherals such as comparator, operational amplifier and ADC (if
available). In this case, the DAC output channel can be disconnected from the DACx_OUTy
output pin and the corresponding GPIO can be used for another purpose.
The DAC output can be buffered or not. The sample and hold block and its associated
registers can run in Stop mode using the LSI clock source.
22.4.2 DAC channel enable
Each DAC channel can be powered on by setting its corresponding ENx bit in the DAC_CR
register. The DAC channel is then enabled after a tWAKEUP startup time.
Note: The ENx bit enables the analog DAC channel x only. The DAC channelx digital interface is
enabled even if the ENx bit is reset.
22.4.3 DAC data format
Depending on the selected configuration mode, the data have to be written into the specified
register as described below:
• Single DAC channel
There are three possibilities:
– 8-bit right alignment: the software has to  load data into the DAC_DHR8Rx[7:0] bits
(stored into the DHRx[11:4] bits)
– 12-bit left alignment: the software has to  load data into the DAC_DHR12Lx [15:4]
bits (stored into the DHRx[11:0] bits)
– 12-bit right alignment: the software has to  load data into the DAC_DHR12Rx [11:0]
bits (stored into the DHRx[11:0] bits)
Depending on the loaded DAC_DHRyyyx register, the data written by the user is shifted and
stored into the corresponding DAC_DHRx (data holding registerx, which are internal non-

memory-mapped registers). The DAC_DHRx register is then loaded into the DAC_DORx
register either automatically, by software trigger or by an external event trigger.
[Figure 164](../figures/figure_164.md). Data registers in single DAC channel mode
• Dual DAC channels (when available)
There are three possibilities:
– 8-bit right alignment: data for DAC channel1 to be loaded into the DAC_DHR8RD
[7:0] bits (stored into the DHR1[11:4] bits) and data for DAC channel2 to be loaded
into the DAC_DHR8RD [15:8] bits (stored into the DHR2[11:4] bits)
– 12-bit left alignment: data for DAC channel1 to be loaded into the DAC_DHR12LD
[15:4] bits (stored into the DHR1[11:0] bits) and data for DAC channel2 to be
loaded into the DAC_DHR12LD [31:20] bits (stored into the DHR2[11:0] bits)
– 12-bit right alignment: data for DAC channel1 to be loaded into the
DAC_DHR12RD [11:0] bits (stored into the DHR1[11:0] bits) and data for DAC
channel2 to be loaded into the DAC_DHR12RD [27:16] bits (stored into the
DHR2[11:0] bits)
Depending on the loaded DAC_DHRyyyD register, the data written by the user is shifted
and stored into DHR1 and DHR2 (data holding registers, which are internal non-memory-
mapped registers). The DHR1 and DHR2 registers are then loaded into the DAC_DOR1
and DOR2 registers, respectively, either automatically, by software trigger or by an external
event trigger.

22.4.4 DAC conversion
The DAC_DORx cannot be written directly and any data transfer to the DAC channelx must
be performed by loading the DAC_DHRx register (write operation to DAC_DHR8Rx,
DAC_DHR12Lx, DAC_DHR12Rx, DAC_DHR8RD, DAC_DHR12RD or DAC_DHR12LD).
Data stored in the DAC_DHRx register are automatically transferred to the DAC_DORx
register after one APB1 clock cycle, if no hardware trigger is selected (TENx bit in DAC_CR
register is reset). However, when a hardware trigger is selected (TENx bit in DAC_CR
register is set) and a trigger occurs, the transfer is performed three APB1 clock cycles after
the trigger signal.
When DAC_DORx is loaded with the DAC_DHRx contents, the analog output voltage
becomes available after a time tSETTLING that depends on the power supply voltage and the
analog output load.
HFSEL bit of DAC_CR must be set when APB1 clock speed is faster than 80 MHz. It adds
an extra delay of three APB1 clock cycles to the transfer from DAC_DHRx register to
DAC_DORx register (tSETTLING).
The DAC_DORx update rate is limited to 1/3 of APB1 clock frequency. When HFSEL bit is
set, this rate is limited to 1/8 of the APB1 clock frequency.
When HFSEL is set, it is not allowed to write to the DAC_DHRx register during a period of
eight clock cycles after the ENx bit is set. During this period, making software/hardware
triggering is not allowed either.
[Figure 166](../figures/figure_166.md). Timing diagram for conversion with trigger disabled TEN = 0
22.4.5 DAC output voltage
Digital inputs are converted to output voltages on a linear conversion between 0 and VREF+.
The analog output voltages on each DAC channel pin are determined by the following
equation:

22.4.6 DAC trigger selection
If the TENx control bit is set, the conversion can then be triggered by an external event (timer
counter, external interrupt line). The TSELx[3:0] control bits determine which out of 16 pos-
sible events triggers the conversion as shown in TSELx[3:0] bits of the DAC_CR register.
These events can be either the software trigger or hardware triggers.
Each time a DAC interface detects a rising edge on the selected trigger source (refer to the
table below), the last data stored into the DAC_DHRx register are transferred into the
DAC_DORx register. The DAC_DORx register is updated three APB1 cycles after the
trigger occurs.
If the software trigger is selected, the conversion starts once the SWTRIG bit is set.
SWTRIG is reset by hardware once the DAC_DORx register has been loaded with the
DAC_DHRx register contents.
Note:  TSELx[3:0] bit cannot be changed when the ENx bit is set.
When software trigger is selected, the transfer from the DAC_DHRx register to the
DAC_DORx register takes only one APB1 clock cycle.

22.4.7 DMA requests
Each DAC channel has a DMA capability. Two DMA channels are used to service DAC
channel DMA requests.
When an external trigger (but not a software trigger) occurs while the DMAENx bit is set, the
value of the DAC_DHRx register is transferred into the DAC_DORx register when the
transfer is complete, and a DMA request is generated.
In dual mode, if both DMAENx bits are set, two DMA requests are generated. If only one
DMA request is needed, only the corresponding DMAENx bit must be set. In this way, the
application can manage both DAC channels in dual mode by using one DMA request and a
unique DMA channel.
As DAC_DHRx to DAC_DORx data transfer occurred before the DMA request, the very first
data has to be written to the DAC_DHRx before the first trigger event occurs.
DMA underrun
The DAC DMA request is not queued so that if a second external trigger arrives before the
acknowledgment for the first external trigger is received (first request), then no new request
is issued and the DMA channelx underrun flag DMAUDRx in the DAC_SR register is set,
reporting the error condition. The DAC channelx continues to convert old data.
The software must clear the DMAUDRx flag by writing 1, clear the DMAEN bit of the used
DMA stream and re-initialize both DMA and DAC channelx to restart the transfer correctly.
The software must modify the DAC trigger conversion frequency or lighten the DMA
workload to avoid a new DMA underrun. Finally, the DAC conversion can be resumed
by enabling both DMA data transfer and conversion trigger.
For each DAC channelx, an interrupt is also generated if its corresponding DMAUDRIEx bit
in the DAC_CR register is enabled.
22.4.8 Noise generation
In order to generate a variable-amplitude pseudonoise, an LFSR (linear feedback shift
register) is available. DAC noise generation is selected by setting WAVEx[1:0] to 01. The
preloaded value in LFSR is 0xAAA. This register is updated three APB1 clock cycles after
each trigger event, following a specific calculation algorithm.

Digital-to-analog converter (DAC) RM0438
804/2187 RM0438 Rev 8
[Figure 167](../figures/figure_167.md). DAC LFSR register calculation algorithm
The LFSR value, that may be masked partially or totally by means of the MAMPx[3:0] bits in
the DAC_CR register, is added up to the DAC_DHRx contents without overflow and this
value is then transferred into the DAC_DORx register.
If LFSR is 0x0000, a 1 is injected into it (antilock-up mechanism).
It is possible to reset LFSR wave generation by resetting the WAVEx[1:0] bits.

22.4.9 Triangle-wave generation
It is possible to add a small-amplitude triangular waveform on a DC or slowly varying signal.
DAC triangle-wave generation is selected by setting WAVEx[1:0] to 10. The amplitude is
configured through the MAMPx[3:0] bits in the DAC_CR register. An internal triangle counter
is incremented three APB1 clock cycles after each trigger event. The value of this counter is
then added to the DAC_DHRx register without overflow and the sum is transferred into the
DAC_DORx register. The triangle counter is incremented as long as it is less than the
maximum amplitude defined by the MAMPx[3:0] bits. Once the configured amplitude is
reached, the counter is decremented down to 0, then incremented again and so on.
It is possible to reset triangle wave generation by resetting the WAVEx[1:0] bits.

22.4.10  DAC channel modes
Each DAC channel can be configured in normal mode or sample and hold mode. The output
buffer can be enabled to obtain a high drive capability. Before enabling output buffer, the
voltage offset needs to be calibrated. This calibration is performed at the factory (loaded
after reset) and can be adjusted by software during application operation.
Normal mode
In normal mode, there are four combinations, by changing the buffer state and by changing
the DACx_OUTy pin interconnections.
To enable the output buffer, the MODEx[2:0] bits in DAC_MCR register must be:
• 000: DAC is connected to the external pin
• 001: DAC is connected to external pin and to on-chip peripherals
To disable the output buffer, the MODEx[2:0] bits in DAC_MCR register must be:
• 010: DAC is connected to the external pin
• 011: DAC is connected to on-chip peripherals
Sample and hold mode
In sample and hold mode, the DAC core converts data on a triggered conversion, and then
holds the converted voltage on a capacitor. When not converting, the DAC cores and buffer
are completely turned off between samples and the DAC output is tri-stated, therefore
reducing the overall power consumption. A stabilization period, which value depends on the
buffer state, is required before each new conversion.
In this mode, the DAC core and all corresponding logic and registers are driven by the LSI
low-speed clock in addition to the APB1 clock, allowing using the DAC channels in deep low
power modes such as Stop mode.
The LSI low-speed clock must not be stopped when the sample and hold mode is enabled.
The sample/hold mode operations can be divided into three phases:
1. Sample phase: the sample/hold element is charged to the desired voltage. The
charging time depends on capacitor value (internal or external, selected by the user).
The sampling time is configured with the TSAMPLEx[9:0] bits in DAC_SHSRx register.
During the write of the TSAMPLEx[9:0] bits, the BWSTx bit in DAC_SR register is set to
1 to synchronize between both clocks domains (APB and low speed clock) and
allowing the software to change the value of sample phase during the DAC channel
operation
2. Hold phase: the DAC output channel is tri-stated, the DAC core and the buffer are
turned off, to reduce the current consumption. The hold time is configured with the
THOLDx[9:0] bits in DAC_SHHR register
3. Refresh phase: the refresh time is configured with the TREFRESHx[7:0] bits in
DAC_SHRR register
The timings for the three phases above are in units of LSI clock periods. As an example, to
configure a sample time of 350 µs, a hold time of 2 ms and a refresh time of 100 µs
assuming LSI ~32 KHz is selected:
• 12 cycles are required for sample phase: TSAMPLEx[9:0] = 11.
• 62 cycles are required for hold phase: THOLDx[9:0] = 62.
• and 4 cycles are required for refresh period: TREFRESHx[7:0] = 4.

RM0438 Rev 8 807/2187
RM0438 Digital-to-analog converter (DAC)
832
In this example, the power consumption is reduced by almost a factor of 15 versus normal
modes.
The formulas to compute the right sample and refresh timings are described in the table
below, the Hold time depends on the leakage current.

[Figure 171](../figures/figure_171.md). DAC sample and hold mode phase diagram
Like in normal mode, the sample and hold mode has different configurations.
To enable the output buffer, MODEx[2:0] bits in DAC_MCR register must be set to:
• 100: DAC is connected to the external pin
• 101: DAC is connected to external pin and to on chip peripherals
To disabled the output buffer, MODEx[2:0] bits in DAC_MCR register must be set to:
• 110: DAC is connected to external pin and to on chip peripherals
• 111: DAC is connected to on chip peripherals
When MODEx[2:0] bits are equal to 111, an internal capacitor, CLint, holds the voltage
output of the DAC core and then drive it to on-chip peripherals.
All sample and hold phases are interruptible, and any change in DAC_DHRx immediately
triggers a new sample phase.

22.4.11 DAC channel buffer calibration
The transfer function for an N-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is:
Where VOUT is the analog output, D is the digital input, G is the gain, VREF is the nominal
full-scale voltage, and VOS is the offset voltage. For an ideal DAC channel, G = 1 and
VOS =0 .
Due to output buffer characteristics, the voltage offset may differ from part-to-part and
introduce an absolute offset error on the analog output. To compensate the VOS, a
calibration is required by a trimming technique.
The calibration is only valid when the DAC channelx is operating with buffer enabled
(MODEx[2:0] = 0b000 or 0b001 or 0b100 or 0b101). if applied in other modes when the
buffer is off, it has no effect. During the calibration:
• The buffer output is disconnected from the pin internal/external connections and put in
tristate mode (HiZ).
• The buffer acts as a comparator to sense the middle-code value 0x800 and compare it
to VREF+/2 signal through an internal bridge, then toggle its output signal to 0 or 1
depending on the comparison result (CAL_FLAGx bit).
Two calibration techniques are provided:
• Factory trimming (default setting)
The DAC buffer offset is factory trimmed. The default value of OTRIMx[4:0] bits in
DAC_CCR register is the factory trimming value and it is loaded once DAC digital
interface is reset.
• User trimming
The user trimming can be done when the operating conditions differs from nominal
factory trimming conditions and in particular when VDDA voltage, temperature, VREF+
values change and can be done at any point during application by software.
Note: Refer to the datasheet for more details of the nominal factory trimming conditions.
In addition, when VDD is removed (example the device enters in Standby or VBAT modes)
the calibration is required.

The steps to perform a user trimming calibration are as below:
1. If the DAC channel is active, write 0 to ENx bit in DAC_CR to disable the channel.
2. Select a mode where the buffer is e nabled, by writing to DAC_MCR register,
MODEx[2:0] = 0b000 or 0b001 or 0b100 or 0b101.
3. Start the DAC channelx calibration, by se tting the CENx bit in DAC_CR register to 1.
4. Apply a trimming algorithm:
a) Write a code into OTRIMx[4:0] bits, starting by 0b00000.
b) Wait for t TRIM delay.
c) Check if CAL_FLAGx bit in DAC_SR is set to 1.
d) Until the CAL_FLAGx is read as 1 or the maximum trimming code is reached,
increment OTRIMx[4:0] and repeat substeps from (b) to (d).
The software algorithm may use either a successive approximation or dichotomy techniques
to compute and set the content of OTRIMx[4:0] bits in a faster way.
Note: A t TRIM delay must be respected between the write to the OTRIMx[4:0] bits and the read of
the CAL_FLAGx bit in DAC_SR register in order to get a correct value.This parameter is
specified into datasheet electrical characteristics section.
If VDDA, VREF+ and temperature conditions do not change during device operation while it
enters more often in Standby and VBAT modes, the software may store the OTRIMx[4:0]
bits found in the first user calibration in the flash or in back-up registers. then to load/write
them directly when the device power is back again thus avoiding to wait for a new calibration
time.
When CENx bit is set, it is not allowed to set ENx bit.
22.4.12 DAC channel conversion modes
Four conversion modes are possible.
Independent trigger without wave generation
To configure the DAC in this conversion mode, the following sequence is required:
1. Set the DAC channel trigger enable bit, TENx.
2. Configure the trigger sources by setting different values in the TSELx[3:0] bits.
3. Load the DAC channel data into the desired DHR registers (DAC_DHR12R1,
DAC_DHR12L1 or DAC_DHR8R1).
When a DAC channel trigger arrives, the DHRx register is transferred into DAC_DORx
(three APB1 clock cycles later).
Independent trigger with single LFSR generation
To configure the DAC in this conversion mode, the following sequence is required:
1. Set the DAC channel trigger enable bit, TENx.
2. Configure the trigger sources by setting different values in the TSELx[3:0] bits.
3. Configure the DAC channel WAVEx[1:0] bits as 01 and the same LFSR mask value in
the MAMPx[3:0] bits.
4. Load the DAC channel data into the desired DHR register (DAC_DHR12R1,
DAC_DHR12L1 or DAC_DHR8R1).

When a DAC channel trigger arrives, the LFSR1 counter, with the same mask, is added to
the DHR1 register and the sum is transferred into DAC_DOR1 (three APB1 clock cycles
later). Then the LFSR1 counter is updated.
Independent trigger with single triangle generation
To configure the DAC in this conversion mode, the following sequence is required:
1. Set the DAC channel trigger enable bits, TENx.
2. Configure the trigger sources by setting different values in the TSELx[3:0] bits.
3. Configure the DAC channel WAVEx[1:0] bits  as 1x and the same maximum amplitude
value in the MAMPx[3:0] bits.
4. Load the DAC channel data into the desired DHR register (DAC_DHR12R1,
DAC_DHR12L1 or DAC_DHR8R1).
When a DAC channel trigger arrives, the DAC channel triangle counter, with the same
triangle amplitude, is added to the DHRx register and the sum is transferred into
DAC_DOR1 (three APB1 clock cycles later). The DAC channel triangle counter is then
updated.
Independent trigger with single sawtooth generation
To configure the DAC in this conversion mode, the following sequence is required:
1. Configure the trigger sources by setting different values in STRSTTRIGSELx[3:0] and
STINCTRIGSELx[3:0] bits.
2. Configure the DAC channel WAVEx[1:0] bits to 11 and set the same
STRSTDATAx[11:0], STINCDATAx[15:0] and STDIRx values for each register.
When a DAC channel trigger arrives, the DAC channel sawtooth counter updates the DHRx
register and transfers it into DAC_DOR1 (three APB clock cycles later).
22.4.13 Dual DAC channel conversi on modes (if dual channels are
available)
To efficiently use the bus bandwidth in applications that require the two DAC channels at the
same time, three dual registers are implemented: DHR8RD, DHR12RD and DHR12LD. A
unique register access is then required to drive both DAC channels at the same time. For
the wave generation, no accesses to DHRxxxD registers are required. As a result, two
output channels can be used either independently or simultaneously.
11 conversion modes are possible using the two DAC channels and these dual registers. All
the conversion modes can nevertheless be obtained using separate DAC_DHRx registers if
needed.
All modes are described in the paragraphs below.

To configure the DAC in this conversion mode, the following sequence is required:
1. Set the two DAC channel trigger enable bits TEN1 and TEN2.

bitfields.
3. Load the dual DAC channel data into the desired DHR register (DAC_DHR12RD,
DAC_DHR12LD or DAC_DHR8RD).
